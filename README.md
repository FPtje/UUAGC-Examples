# UUAGC-Examples
Contains some guides and examples related to the Utrecht University Attribute Grammar Compiler (UUAGC)

## Guides
- [Setting up UUAGC](https://github.com/FPtje/UUAGC-Examples/wiki/Setting-up-UUAGC)

## Examples
The `examples` folder contains some examples. Here's a list of examples, describing what they show

- [**01-pure**](examples/pure) - Has a data structure called `Expression` defined in an AG file and shows how to work with different kinds of attributes on it.
- [**02-applied**](examples/applied) - Sometimes the ADT that you want to use UUAGC with is already defined, exists in some library or for some other reason cannot be refactored to be defined in an AG file. This example shows how UUAGC can still be used.
