-- NOTE: there is NO module declaration here! That is because this file
-- does not generate any Haskell code. It only exists to tell UUAGC
-- the structure of the Expression ADT, which is defined in src/Expression.hs


-- Type alias to let UUAGC reason about lists of expressions
type ExprList = [Expression]


-- This Expression declaration MUST follow the same structure
-- as the actual original data definition, in this case defined in
-- src/Expression.hs
-- Note that each field must be given a name. If they don't exist in the
-- original definition (as is the case in src/Expression.hs), you can use
-- arbitrary names.
data Expression
    -- Represents literal number
    | Number
        value :: Int

    -- Adding two expressions
    | Add
        left :: Expression

    -- Multiplying two expressions
    | Multiply
        left :: Expression
